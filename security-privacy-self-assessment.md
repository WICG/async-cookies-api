[Security and Privacy questionnaire](https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/)
responses for the Cookie Store API

### 3.1 Does this specification deal with personally-identifiable information?

No.

### 3.2 Does this specification deal with high-value data?

Yes.

### 3.3 Does this specification introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions?

No.

Particularly in the case for Service Workers, we think that Service Workers can currently effectively access the cookies of any URL under their scope. For example, a service worker could respond to any top-level request with an HTML document embedding an `<iframe>` pointing to the desired URL. When responding to the request for that URL, the Service Worker can respond with an HTML document containing a `<script>` that implements a postMessage API that proxies the Service Worker's access to the document.cookie API.

This specification offers high-performance methods for accessing HTTP cookies,
which have already become an established part of the Web platform. No new state
mechanism is introduced.

### 3.4 Does this specification expose persistent, cross-origin state to the web?

Yes. However, it does not expose any **new** persistent cross-origin state.

This specification defers to
[RFC 6265bis](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03) for
the storage and security models of HTTP cookies. Cookies can be scoped to an
entire eTLD+1, transcending the same origin policy. For example, a cookie
whose
[domain](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-4.1.2.3)
attribute is set to `example.com` is visible to `www.example.com` and
`foo.example.com`.

[document.cookie](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#dom-document-cookie)
already exposes HTTP cookies. This specification does not open up access to
cookies past what `document.cookie` has to offer.

### 3.5 Does this specification expose any other data to an origin that it doesn’t currently have access to?

No.

### 3.6 Does this specification enable new script execution/loading mechanisms?

No.

### 3.7 Does this specification allow an origin access to a user’s location?

No.

### 3.8 Does this specification allow an origin access to sensors on a user’s device?

No.

### 3.9 Does this specification allow an origin access to aspects of a user’s local computing environment?

No.

### 3.10 Does this specification allow an origin access to other devices?

No.

### 3.11 Does this specification allow an origin some measure of control over a user agent’s native UI?

No.

### 3.12 Does this specification expose temporary identifiers to the web?

No.

### 3.13 Does this specification distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts?

No.

This specification defers to
[RFC 6265bis](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03) for
the storage and security models of HTTP cookies. Cookies have a
[SameSite](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-4.1.2.7)
attribute that introduces differences in behavior between first-party and
third-party contexts.

This specification includes a method for accessing a cookie's SameSite
attribute.

### 3.14 How should this specification work in the context of a user agent’s "incognito" mode?

This specification builds on top of HTTP cookies as defined in
[RFC 6265bis](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03). The
specification should be compatible with any manner user agents choose to handle
 cookies in "incognito".

### 3.15 Does this specification persist data to a user’s local device?

Yes. However, it does not introduce any **new** persistence mechanism.

### 3.16 Does this specification have a "Security Considerations" and "Privacy Considerations" section?

No.

The specification will defer to
[RFC 6265bis](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03) for
its extensive treatment of
[Security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-8)
and
[Privacy](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-7)
issues.

### 3.17 Does this specification allow downgrading default security characteristics?

No.
